<p>If none of these restaurants meet your needs, there is always the option of bringing your own food. Food is welcome at the beach; however, you may only eat in the designated picnic area. We highly stress this too avoid littering. Please pick up after yourself.</p>
<p>Many of these restaurants are a bit high priced, bt acordig to customers, the price is worth it. We hope you will have an easy time fining a restaurant and eating comfortably.</p>
