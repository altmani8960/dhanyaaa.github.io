    <h2>Swimming</h2>
    <p>The waves here at La Jolla Shores are for everyone. During the day, the waves are ot too rough so that someone looking to relax can have a nice time. As it gets closer to the night, the waves get bigger and are made for more intense swimmers.</p>

    <h2>Relaxing</h2>
    <p>La Jolla Shores has very soft sand and feels almost like cotton when you walk along it barefoot. If you do not plan on getting wet or going in the water, you can always just sit in the soft sand and watch the waves or tan. There are also bonfire areas that you can use at night to keep warm or make s'mores.</p>

    <h2>Surfing</h2>
  
  <p>The waves at La Jolla Shores are really good for surfing especially towards the night. You do not need to worry about getting in anyone's way as we have a designated spot that is only for surfers.</p>
